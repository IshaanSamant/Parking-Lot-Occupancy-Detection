# Parking-Lot-Occupancy-Detection
An advanced system that can determine the number of occupied parking spots in a parking lot, only using camera footage.
Instead of using regular object detection we implemented Instance Segmentation via Mask RCNN as it was better in 
detecting cars even in the presence of occlusion.
